Take a deep breath and escape to the magical outdoors and adventure at **Table Mountain Gilgil**, a stand-alone hill located along the escarpment of the Great Rift valley in a small portion of forest called Maji Moto. The hill offers a panoramic view of the beautiful landscape of **Lake Elementaita, Sleeping Warrior, and the Aberdares**.

#### Lake Elementaita

The hiking trail starts at **Kikopey along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway**; the journey from Nairobi to Kikopey is about `2.5 hours`. The trail starts with a steep ascent; luckily, the serene view of the pristine Lake Elementaita is one of the bonus sceneries that make the commitment worth it.
The trail further takes a short descent through bushlands, across two river crossings, and up another brief steep ascent.

#### The Summit

The final gentle trek leads to the magnificent Table Mountain.
Although getting to the summit of Table Mountain is the most challenging part of the hike as it is extremely rocky, you will get the best panoramic view of the moorlands and vast ridges of the Aberdares at the top. As there are no trees on top of the plateau, you might want to take your snacks at the hot springs, which are just a brief descent away.

After a refreshing rest at the hot springs we start our descend.
