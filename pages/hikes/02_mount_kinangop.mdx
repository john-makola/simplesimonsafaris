**Mt Kinangop is the second-highest peak in the Aberdares**. On a clear day, you can see nearby Elephant hill, and possibly as far as Mt. Longonot and Lake Naivasha. Like most other trails in the Aberdares, the trail ascends through the various vegetation zones, including forest, bamboo, montane humid forest and the moorland zone of the Aberdares plateau.

##### North Kinangop Forest

The trail starts at the North Kinangop Forest Station at Mutarakwa. From here, the `first 2 km (1.3miles)` run through relatively flat forest and farmland, before one enters the protected forest through a gate on your righthand side. The next `6km (3.5 mile)` ascends up the central **Aberdares ridge**, through the various vegetation zones.

##### Aberdare Ridge

This part of the trail can be `muddy` _(especially after rains)_ and is also the habitat of `occasional buffalos and elephants`, whose footprints or droppings may be encountered along the trail. In parts, the trail can be a bit overgrown, but there are trailblazers to guide your way. Once on the Aberdare ridge, the trail turns South for another `6km (3.5 mile)`, ascending gently towards **Kinangop peak**. The final ascent of the peak is steep and can be done through the grassy western approach, or the rocky southern approach. It is possible to traverse onwards to Elephant hill.
