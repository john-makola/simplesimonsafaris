Mt. Kipipiri Hike is an exciting start to mountaineering as most other Aberdare hikes. It is a perfect trail for hikers looking for a challenge, starting at the **Geta Forest Station** near Getabush, up to the `Mt. Kipipiri summit (3,363m ASL)`, and then down a steep `4.5-km stretch`.

#### ⚠ Allergy Warning: Bees, Pollen.

The hike starts at a well-paved dirt road before detouring into a graciously endowed rainforest with wildlife and panoramic treats of the **Nyandarua Range, Lake Naivasha, and Lake Olboloosat.** Hikers should be ready for a `13-km walk` to **Mt. Kipipiri summit**, which certainly demands resolve. However, the beautiful fauna and flora, and enthralling forest scents make it worth it.
